# Missing Return Statement in Next.js 15 Page Component

This repository demonstrates a common error in Next.js 15: forgetting to include a `return` statement in a page component.  This can lead to unexpected behavior or runtime errors.

## Bug

The `pages/about.js` file is missing a `return` statement in its functional component.  This will result in a Next.js build error or runtime warning.

## Solution

The `pages/aboutSolution.js` file shows the corrected code with the necessary `return` statement added.  Make sure every page component explicitly returns JSX.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Observe the error in the terminal.
